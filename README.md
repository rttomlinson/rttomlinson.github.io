Hello, my name is Renzo.

Take a look around and let me know if you have any questions.

About me,

A dietitian and rock climber, moved to Alaska to work in long-term care where I learned about the 
simpler parts of live and was able to appreciate nature and food and the nuances of the American 
Healthcare System. Afterwards I worked in California, back to Alaska for a summer on a commercial 
fishing vessel, then spending 3 months rock climbing and biking down the West Coast. The time spent 
in Alaska left a impression on me that we can more improvements in healthcare and the need for 
accurate and noninvasive data collection that will help us to improve lives without getting in the way.
My appreciation for climbing and the outdoors fuels my desire to help anyone who wants to live their 
live to the highest potential. I see my experience and training in medicine messed with the skillset 
of a developer critical and crafting solutions that are robust and practical and a pleasure to use.
